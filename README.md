This is the first draft of the README.md

Welcome to ggGURPS. A web application (currently just a web API) to facilitate GURPS campaigns.

GURPS is an RPG system published by Steve Jackson Games. Its name means Generic Universal Role Playing System. It's a very complex and complete RPG system.

ggGURPS currently uses .NET 5 as the backend framework and the plan is to use VueJS with VueX as the frontend framework.
